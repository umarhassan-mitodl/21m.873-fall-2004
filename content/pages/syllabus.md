Prerequisite
------------

At least one studio subject or permission of instructor.

Description
-----------

Directed practice in acting, directing, or design on a sustained theater piece, either one-act or full length, from pre-rehearsal preparation to workshop production. Consult Theater Arts Office. Includes directed practice in stagecraft. Dramashop rehearses a production of Anne Washburn's play "The Internationalist" for presentation the first two weekends in February. Janet Sonenberg directs. Approximately 10 roles filled by auditions on November 29, 30 and December 1, 6:30-10 PM. Students can receive up to six credits for acting or technical positions. Schedule of rehearsals to be arranged, but actors should be available during the day. Students must be available for performances in early February.

Grading Policy
--------------

We will rehearse--in individual scenes--from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. Once technical and dress rehearsals begin, we are all called upon to turn in more time. And of course, you must be available for every performance, and for the brush-up rehearsal between the two weeks of performance. As you all know there is zero tolerance for lateness or absence. The only conflicts you may take are the ones we reported at the auditions. Your participation in the production in the set shop, during the light hang, put in, strike, etc., is required. Taken together, this is a great deal of work, but that is what it 0takes to produce a play.

I expect each of you to fulfill these expectations to the highest degree possible, in which case you will receive an A. Average work that technically, though not fully, meets these expectations will merit a B. If you fail to meet all of the requirements and your work is lackadaisical, your grade will be a C or less.
